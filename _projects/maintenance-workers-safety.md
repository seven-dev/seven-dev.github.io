## Project overview

The primary objective of this project was to ensure the safety of maintenance workers and enforce protocol compliance. We achieved this by equipping workers with a camera and various sensors to monitor their safety and promptly alert the backoffice in case of any incidents, such as explosions or falls.

### Key Features

- **Ensure safety of workers**: We employed machine learning to detect if workers were wearing gloves and to identify any unusual sounds or movements. Additionally, a sensor was integrated to verify helmet usage.  
- **Backoffice**: The backoffice was used to monitor and assist in multiple operations in parallel. It allowed the operators to get notified immediately whenever there was a problem and allowed them to make video calls directly to the workers.  
- **App**: An app was developed to facilitate video calls between the backoffice and workers, designed to be user-friendly even when wearing gloves. It would also guide the safety procedures.  

### Development and execution

The project was executed by a team of two, with occasional assistance, over a period of three months.  

It involved tasks such as:

- **Prototyping and architectural design**: We conceptualized and designed the project architecture.
- **Data collection and model training**: Collected data and trained models to detect gloves, explosions, and impacts.
- **Backoffice development**: Created a real-time alert system for the backoffice.
- **App development**: Built an app for video calls and operational assistance.
- **Circuit design and assembly**: Designed and assembled a circuit with a sensor and microprocessor to detect helmet usage.
- **3D modeling**: Created a support structure for the helmet circuit.
- **Cloud deployment**: Deployed various services to the cloud to ensure accessibility for workers wherever they are.


Some of the technologies used were: **Python**, **C++**, **Kotlin**, **Java**, **OpenCV**, **Pytorch**, among others.

### Conclusion

This project was an exceptional experience, integrating various components such as web, IoT, electronics, machine learning, and mobile development. The challenge of continuously learning and implementing diverse solutions within a short timeframe made it a very intense and exciting project. It allowed me to grow and learn significantly in my profession.
