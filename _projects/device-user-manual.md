### Project overview

The goal of this project was to develop an interactive app for a telecommunications service provider, enabling customers to upgrade their old TV box devices to a newer version. The app was designed to guide users through the upgrade process using Augmented Reality (AR).

### Key features

- **AR guidance**: Users can point their phones at the TV box, and the app overlays step-by-step instructions directly onto the device, even accurately identifying smaller details such as each of the box's I/O sockets (HDMI, USB, ...).
- **Simple user experience**: Clear and concise instructions to ensure a smooth upgrade experience, including guidance on where to place each cable and which tests to perform, making the process easy to follow.

### Development and execution

The project was developed by a team of 3 people. It involved:

- **Prototyping with different technologies**: To find the optimal solution, we built several prototypes using different AR technologies. This iterative process helped us evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each technology, leading us to choose ARKit and SceneKit for their robustness and ease of integration.  
- **Training the 3D object detection model**: We trained a 3D object detection model to accurately identify the TV boxes and their input sockets. This involved collecting a dataset of images of the devices.
- **Learning new technologies**: As I had no prior experience with ARKit, Swift, and SceneKit, I quickly adapted and learned these technologies during the development process. This experience demonstrated my ability to rapidly acquire new technical skills and apply them effectively.
- **Team collaboration**: Worked collaboratively with two colleagues, dividing tasks based on individual strengths. We integrated our efforts to create a cohesive and functional final product.

Technologies used include **ARKit**, **SceneKit**, **Swift**, **ARCore**, **Wikitude**, **iOS development**, and others.

### Conclusion

The project successfully resulted in a functional and engaging AR app that simplifies the TV box upgrade process for customers. The innovative use of AR received positive feedback for enhancing user experience and demonstrating the practical application of emerging technologies.
