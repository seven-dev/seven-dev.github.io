### Project overview

The goal of this project was to enhance a social robot by teaching it new skills. I developed functionalities that allow the robot to display videos on its screen and play various games designed for children.  
Its development style was similar to that used for creating Alexa and Google Assistant skills, both of which I also have experience with.  

### Development and execution

This project involved:

- Creating video playback functionality for the robot's screen using Youtube's API.  
- Creating a prototype for a therapist chatbot that could keep the conversation going indefinitely.  
- Designing and implementing various interactive games tailored for children.  
- Creating various tools to simplify the work using Python.  
- Collaborating with UX/UI teams to design the skills.  
- Following SCRUM principles.  

Technologies used include **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, **Python**, **Kibana**, **Electron**, among others.  

### Conclusion

This project required me to adapt to new technologies and thrive in a fast-paced, prototype-focused development environment. This experience improved my teamwork skills and my ability to deliver high-quality results under challenging conditions.
